# WHAT A WASTE: Recovering Trash from Philippine Landfills with Object Detection
 This project tackles the Philippines' waste management crisis driven by its "sachet economy" and reliance on single-use plastics. To enhance waste sorting in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), a YOLOv8-based object detection model was developed. Initial performance on Philippine waste data was low (mAP@50: 23%) due to training-test data discrepancies. By augmenting the dataset with Philippine-specific waste images via web scraping, the model's accuracy improved significantly, achieving an mAP@50 of 71%.
